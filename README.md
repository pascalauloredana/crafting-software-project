# crafting-software-project

## Description
This is a small project for the Crafting Software tehnical interviu.

## Problem solved
Given a list of words and a string made up of those words (no spaces), return the original sentence in a list. If there is more than one possible reconstruction, return any of them. If there is no possible reconstruction, then return an empty array. For example: Given the set of words 'quick', 'brown', 'the', 'fox', and the string "thequickbrownfox", you should return ['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox']. Given the set of words 'bed', 'bath', 'bedbath', 'and', 'beyond', and the string "bedbathandbeyond", return either ['bed', 'bath', 'and', 'beyond] or ['bedbath', 'and', 'beyond']. Try to use functional programming concepts like higher order functions and immutability. Bonus points if you write some unit tests to prove your implementation is correct.
